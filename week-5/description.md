For our social event, we grabbed a snack at the UTC after our classes and got to know each other better. Because we were a team that was formed by the professor, this was the first time we were able to introduce ourselves and discuss our backgrounds and interests.  We are all very different people who come from different places, so it will be very interesting to see how our team works together throughout the next 28 weeks.

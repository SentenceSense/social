For our social event, we went out to lunch and grabbed a burger at In-n-Out. It was a hot day and we all decided that we wanted a burger and some pink lemonade. The conversation was taken over by details of the project and what else needed to be done for the week. It was nice to get out of the 90+ degree weather and get to enjoy a meal with the team.
